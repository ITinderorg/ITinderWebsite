## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

## Pages in Next.js

In Next.js, a page is a React Component exported from a file in the pages directory.

Pages are associated with a route based on their file name. For example, in development:

pages/index.js is associated with the / route.
pages/posts/first-post.js is associated with the /posts/first-post route.

## Naming convention

Coming soon...
